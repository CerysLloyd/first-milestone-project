## User-Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 1.

![Mockup](assets/md_images/themockup.png)

Website presents an informative platform for users to find content relating to the fictional womens only gym called "Women Only Workouts". 

As part of the Code Institutes milestone project 1, the main aim of this project is to build a responsive website with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I have decided to use bootstrap as my framework for consistency and ease of use.

## Issues found during site development

* #### Navbar Alignment.
![testing_issue_1](assets/md_images/navbar-alignment.png)

I used [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/#toggler) to create the navbar and then customised the css to apply the desired look. However I could not get the text to sit to the right hand side of the page.
Using mozzilla developer tools I applied *margin-right* elements and *padding* but this caused problems with the responsiveness in smaller screens. I tried *justify-content* elements and they didn't work either. 

>I read bootstraps documentation on [Spacing](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/spacing/) and [flex](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/flex/) but didn't find the answer.

>I watched a you-tube tutorial by [RTECH-INFO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozCItmwbgvc) which outline the *me-auto* and *ms-auto* functions and changed the code within github to follow these new rules.

Code before applying the new rule.
![testing_issue_1_Code](assets/md_images/navbar-code.png) 
Code after applying the new rule.
![testing_issue-1_newcode](assets/md_images/navbar-code2.png) 

> After gaining more experience with bootstrap I also altered the code snippet that bootstrap provided; removing the search bar. I applied custom css to the navbar for styling, using the Mozzilla developer to ensure that all code was responsive. Below is an image of the final Navbar.

![testing_issue_1_resolved](assets/md_images/finalnav.png)

* #### Navbar Alignment.
![testing_issue_2](assets/md_images/col-row-layout.png)

I orignially used the same style template as the [Code Institute Love Running Project](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+CSE101+2020_Q2/courseware/be0e510a3aca4bccb6e0bba4cf7cf06b/6eb8cfc87bfd434a87861a844e00b655/) with the *col* and *row* system to try and replicate the writing in line with the image for the classes pages and the home page of my project. 

It lead to a whole host of responsive design issues when trying to float the *cols* left and right. 
![testing_issue_2](assets/md_images/col-row-layout.png)

> I watched a tutorial to better understand the relationship between *rows and cols* [Acedemind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmPmwdshCMw)

> I rewatched Code Institute videos regarding *div and span* rules I also read the [containers information](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/#how-they-work) available at Bootstrap, to completley get to grips with the grid system. 

> After gaining more experience with bootstrap I became aware of the [Grid cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/#grid-cards) and their responsivity built in. I used custom styling using the mozzilla developer to ensure that the code was responsive on all devices. 

![testing_issue_2_resolved](assets/md_images/layout-fixed.png)

* #### Footer Newsletter Sign Up, Button Missing.
![testing _issue_3](assets/md_images/footerbutton1.png)

I orignally tried to mimic/ adapt the code from the the [Code Institute- Rosie Project](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/616289d66b5641a3808cc43e53842695/b51f7b8b815c4bcd9979d2281b6d97a9/) for the footer as I liked the elements grouping, but the design I was working on didn't really call for the quantity of *cols* used.

>I didn't want to leave the remaining space in the footer blank... usually there would be room here for the contact details, but I have included a contact page in the design. I opted to place a "sign up to our newsletter" email input into this element to encourage new and existing members to sign up for further information from the business.

I added the code from the *navbar search bar* that I had originally installed from [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/#toggler), and was going to further edit the code to apply to this, but the button didn't appear. 

I then installed a button element that I had used for the Classes page [testing_issue_3](assets/md_images/footerbutton2.png) 

This caused issues with responiveness and didn't look right. 

>I researched other options available for *input and button* options using [bootstrap add ons] (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/forms/input-group/#button-addons) and that worked. I changed the *col* settings in the footer from *col-sm-8, col-sm-4* to *col-sm-6, col-sm-6* to allow for the button to sit well in the footer.

[testing_issue_3](assets/md_images/footerbutton3.png)

> I customised the css and here is the finished button

[testing_issue_3_resolved] (assets/md_images/footerbutton4.png)

## Performance testing

To test performance I run the  [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) developer tool.
I plan to edit the photos to reduce loading time and increase the performance of the webiste.

[Best Practices](assets/md_images/best-practices.png)

## Code Validation
 Throughout the project I have used 2 validators to check and validate code
 
 * [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate CSS
 * [Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/) to test HTML

# Deployment

This project will be deployed through Github.

Gitpod was the development tool for writing the code: Git add and Git Commit commited all changes to git.
The push command in Gitpod was used to save changes in GitHub.

To deploy the project I had to:

* Log in to GitHub and click on repository to deploy ([Repository](https://github.com/CerysLloyd/first-milestone-project))
* Use the `Settings`button on the command line above the green gitpod button; it has a cog icon.
* Scroll down the page to the 'GitHub Pages' section, almsot near the bottom of the page.
* Inside a highlighted bar: Pages settings now has its own dedicated tab! Check it out here!, click the href link.
* At the top of the page there will be a highlighted href link Your site is published at https://ceryslloyd.github.io/first-milestone-project/
* click and it opens in a new page.
