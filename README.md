Website presents an informative platform for users to find content relating to the fictional womens only gym called "Women Only Workouts". 

As part of the Code Institutes milestone project 1, the main aim of this project is to build a responsive website with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. I have decided to use bootstrap as my framework for consistency and ease of use.
